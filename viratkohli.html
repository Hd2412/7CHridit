        <h3>Early Life and Childhood</h3>
        <p>
            Virat Kohli was born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India. From a young age, he showed a keen interest in cricket, often picking up a bat and practicing for hours. His father, Prem Kohli, recognized his son's talent and enrolled him at the West Delhi Cricket Academy when he was just nine years old. Under the guidance of coach Rajkumar Sharma, Kohli honed his skills and developed into a promising young cricketer.
            <br><br>
            Kohli's journey was not without hardships. The sudden passing of his father in 2006 was a significant personal setback, but instead of letting grief hold him back, he used it as motivation to push himself harder. His commitment to the game was evident when he chose to play a crucial Ranji Trophy match for Delhi just a day after his father's demise.
        </p>

        <h3>Personal Life</h3>
        <p>
            In 2017, Kohli married Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma in an intimate ceremony in Italy. Their relationship has been admired by fans as a symbol of mutual support and understanding. The couple welcomed their daughter, Vamika, in 2021, adding another beautiful chapter to Kohli's personal life.
            <br><br>
            Beyond cricket, Kohli is a fitness enthusiast who has transformed himself into one of the fittest athletes in the world. His dedication to diet, exercise, and an overall disciplined lifestyle has set new benchmarks for cricketers globally.

        <h3>Playing Style and Strengths</h3>
        <p>
            Kohli's batting style is a perfect blend of aggression and technical finesse. He is known for his impeccable cover drives, quick footwork, and ability to build innings under pressure. His hunger for runs and incredible consistency have made him a nightmare for bowlers across all formats.
            <br><br>
            One of Kohli’s defining traits is his ability to chase down targets in One Day Internationals (ODIs). His unmatched ability to read the game, rotate the strike, and accelerate when needed has made him one of the best chase masters in cricket history.
        </p>

        <h3>Legacy and Achievements</h3>
        <p>
            Over the years, Kohli has accumulated numerous records. He is the fastest batsman to score 8,000, 9,000, 10,000, and 11,000 runs in ODIs. His leadership saw India achieve historic victories, including their first-ever Test series win in Australia in 2018-19.
            <br><br>
            Kohli’s impact on Indian cricket extends beyond statistics. His work ethic, fitness standards, and aggressive approach to the game have influenced an entire generation of cricketers. Even after stepping down as captain, his presence in the team remains invaluable.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
