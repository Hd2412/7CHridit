    <div class="content">
        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>
            Virat Kohli was born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India. From a young age, he displayed exceptional talent in cricket and joined the West Delhi Cricket Academy at the age of nine. His parents supported his passion, ensuring he had the resources to hone his skills.
        </p>

        <h3>Rise to Stardom</h3>
        <p>
            Kohli captained the Indian U-19 team to victory in the 2008 World Cup. His impressive performance caught the attention of selectors, and he made his ODI debut later that year. Kohli's hunger for runs and ability to chase targets made him a crucial part of the team.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over the years, Kohli established himself as one of the most consistent performers in international cricket. His aggressive batting style and fitness regime set new benchmarks for cricketers worldwide.
        </p>

        <h3>Achievements</h3>
        <p>
            Kohli's career is studded with numerous accolades. He has over 70 international centuries and is among the fastest to reach milestones in both ODIs and Tests. His leadership saw India achieve historic victories overseas.
        </p>

        <p>
            He was named ICC Player of the Year multiple times and has been a leading run-scorer in several tournaments. Kohli's records in the IPL further cement his status as one of the all-time greats.
        </p>

        <h3>Challenges and Comebacks</h3>
        <p>
            Like any athlete, Kohli faced challenges, including a dip in form and personal losses. However, his resilience and determination helped him bounce back stronger each time.
        </p>

        <h3>Retirement from T20I</h3>
        <p>
            In 2021, Kohli announced his retirement from T20I captaincy to focus on other formats and maintain his fitness. While his leadership in the shortest format ended, his contributions as a player remain invaluable.
        </p>

        <p>
            Kohli's journey from a young boy in Delhi to one of the greatest cricketers is a testament to his hard work, passion, and dedication. His legacy will inspire future generations.
